# Awesome-List-of-Shape-Decomposition-Papers
The ability to parse 3D objects into its constituent parts is
essential for humans to understand and interact with the
surrounding world. Imparting this skill into machines is important for various computer graphics, computer vision
and robotics tasks. Machines endowed with this skill can better interact with its surrounding, perform shape
editing, texturing, recomposing , tracking  and animation.

This list contains a list of papers that concerns with shape decomposition using both classical and modern approaches.
